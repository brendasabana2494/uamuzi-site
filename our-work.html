                                        <p class="w-85 xs-w-100"> Kenya’s 2010 Constitution introduced provisions to its constitutional and legal framework to support the increased participation of youth. Kenyan Youth aged 18-35 comprises of over a third of the population and are a great source of social and economic energy for the Country, yet much of this energy is untapped. Culturally, the older generations’ views are prioritized due to the perception that they have more wisdom and experience than the youth. With the progressive aspect of our Constitution, the right to access information has made it possible for the youth through technology to be engaged in decision making process. With insufficient civic engagement and creation of awareness, the youth are often disadvantaged from actively participating in their own democracy, which fuels sentiments of frustration, unfairness and exclusion.</p>
                                        <p class="w-85 xs-w-100">We provide formal online channels for them to comment on policy, or petition for change at every level of governance (Ward, Constituency, County and Country). Their active participation makes it easy to practice democracy and bringing about good governance in the Country where their voices are heard by the government.</p>

                                        <p class="w-85 xs-w-100">One of the fundamental principles of good governance is transparency and accountability which is accomplished through effective and efficient access to information. It also ensures that decision-making in governance process is adhered to by key actors in governance. Information should be proactively disclosed except as limited by law. </p>
                                        <p class="w-85 xs-w-100">Access to information on transparency and accountability are considered the backbone for democratic governments. There is significant evidence that transparency reduces opportunities for corruption. An informed and politically active youth strengthens the demand for governments to be accountable.</p>
                                        <p class="w-85 xs-w-100">Processes such as online debates, campaigns and social accountability encourage government responsiveness to youth demands and result in better public services. </p>

                                        <p class="w-85 xs-w-100">The principle of gender equality is enshrined in the 2010 Constitution in its Preamble, Fundamental Rights, Fundamental Duties and Directive Principles. The Constitution not only grants equality to women, but also empowers the State to adopt measures of positive discrimination in favor of women including the two-thirds gender rule to be adopted in the legislative houses.</p>
                                        <p class="w-85 xs-w-100"><b>I) Access to information</b> <br> We create a safe space for women to raise awareness and advocate for their representation in governance structures. Information flows to them without distortion or any form of censoring, and they have access to same information as their male counterpart. We create new opportunities by expanding information flows and making communications more accessible. They can make better choices, voice their opinions, demand their rights and have more power over their own lives. <br> Access to and use of the platform is directly linked to social and political development and it is imperative to ensure that women understand its significance. If not, lack of access to information and communication becomes a significant factor in the further marginalization of women from the economic, social, and political mainstream in the country and the world at large.</p>
                                        <p class="w-85 xs-w-100"><b>II) Women in leadership</b> <br> Accordingly, the meaningful participation of women in national, local and community leadership roles has become an important focus on global development policy and agenda. Women's political participation results in tangible gains for democracy, including greater responsiveness to needs, increased cooperation across party and ethnic lines, and a more sustainable future. Most women shy away from politics due to insufficient funds to run their campaigns and more often than not political seats are often viewed to belong to men. <br> These ideals disadvantage women to compete with their male competitors in holding rallies and selling their agenda. Many of them prefer to carry out the door to door campaigns. Upon signing up on Uamuzi App, they will have the same audience with other aspirants running for the same position thus putting everyone on an equal level with the opportunity to sell their blueprint agenda (manifesto) to their electorates.</p>

                                        <p class="w-85 xs-w-100">We promote strong institutions by encouraging inclusivity from people of different backgrounds, communities, tribes, religion, age, abilities, gender and political party affiliation. We provide space for diverse, bottom-up and low-cost communication. Some of the most progressive form of youth engagement identified is when they come together to engage with one another, exchange ideas and concerns, and to negotiate an agreed approach to address issues they are confronted with.</p>
                                        <p class="w-85 xs-w-100">We seek out and facilitate the involvement of those people and groups potentially affected by or interested in a decision. We provide equal and balanced opportunities for all parties to participate effectively. The participation process is conducted in an independent, unbiased way. By building a culture of belonging, we actively invite the contribution and participation of all people. </p>
                                        <p class="w-85 xs-w-100"> We believe every person’s voice adds value and we strive to create balance in the face of power differences.

                                        <p class="w-85 xs-w-100">The potential of Africa’s youth population fuels the narrative of a continent on the rise. Young people have been largely marginalized in governance as well as in development. This has been a threat to peace, a hindrance to development and an obstacle to building a strong democracy. The youth constitutes more than a third of the entire population, nearly 80 per cent of Kenyans are less than 35 years old, while over fifty per cent are young women.</p>
                                        <p class="w-85 xs-w-100">We create space for the youth to actively engage in decision making through inclusive participation by taking up political seats in the general elections and be represented in legislative and governance structures. We do believe in the power of the youth in representing and advocating for their rights in the right forums. Effective youth leadership builds on solid youth principles, with an emphasis on those areas of development and program components that support the youth.</p>
                                        <p class="w-85 xs-w-100"> Involving the youth to be part of leadership recognizes the measurable benefits they have to offer. They can be natured to be leaders built on consensus, not division. They will draw on the widest range of talents and expertise, not the narrow circles of power. They build on empowerment and engagement, because lasting change only happens if people make it happen.</p>

                                        <p class="w-85 xs-w-100">For an election to be successful and democratic, voters must understand their rights and responsibilities. They should be sufficiently knowledgeable and well informed to cast ballots that are legally valid in the participation of a meaningfully voting process. Voter education is even more critical in post-election where political situations may be volatile and elections have an unprecedented impact on the countries’ future.</p>
                                        <p class="w-85 xs-w-100">We conduct continuous civic education programs that employ youth-friendly tactics and reach the grassroots levels, including in rural and remote locations. Discussions include roles and responsibilities of elected and nominated officials, with a focus on the different government positions as well as opportunities for youth participation and civic engagement, including how to provide input into development.</p>
                                        <p class="w-85 xs-w-100"> We also implement targeted and continuous civic education programs in tertiary institutions through policy, civic engagement, youth consultations on political participation, findings and recommendations that focus on different government positions, inclusive and accountable leadership and how to make good and informed decision during election period.

                                        <p class="w-85 xs-w-100">In Kenya and the world at large, persons with disabilities are more likely to experience social injustice than persons without disabilities. Attitudinal and environmental barriers to participation have profound social, economic and cultural effects on them resulting in exclusion. Such exclusion and discrimination in turn contributes to poverty and prevents them from participating in decision-making processes. As a result, their interests and needs are frequently neglected by society. Women and girls with disabilities, who experience discrimination on the basis of multiple aspects of their identities, often face heightened levels of exclusion.</p>
                                        <p class="w-85 xs-w-100">We cannot effectively challenge inequality or advance our social justice mission unless we address the needs, concerns, and priorities of the people around the world who live with disabilities. Their participation in decision making process empowers self-advocates in development processes and convenient access to information.</p>

                                        <p class="w-85 xs-w-100">Technology has revolutionized the way social movements and human rights advocates operate. In a world where the public creates and receives news in real time and information is readily available in a moment’s notice, the process of communication and dissemination has been largely democratized. Individuals can magnify their voice, not only through information consumption and generation, but through active engagement and organizing.</p>
                                        <p class="w-85 xs-w-100">We encourage youth participation and acknowledge the role of youth in public policy formulation, planning, implementation, decision-making and governance in general. Offering a range of activities and providing youth with meaningful opportunities to participate in policy formulation encourages more of their input. In a world where the legitimacy of public policies and other collective actions rests in large measure on the democratic credentials of the processes of their production, it matter a great deal what the youth think, and what actions they consequently support, or are willing to undertake.</p>

It presents perhaps the most profound challenge ever to have confronted human social, political, and economic systems. Technology has become an important tool providing space for the youth to participate in influencing or disallowing environmental decisions historically made by governments and corporations that affect us all.
